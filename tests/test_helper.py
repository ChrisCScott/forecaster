def type_check(val, types):
    """ Recursively checks that all elements in val are of correct type.

    If `types` is iterable, this method (a) tests that `val` is an
    instance of the same iterable type, and (b) tests that each element
    of `val` is an instance of the type at the corresponding level of
    depth in `types`.

    If `types` is an iterable, it must have at most one element. That
    element must be a type object or an iterable which itself has the
    same structure. (If the iterable is empty, the elements of the
    corresponding iterable of `val` are not type-checked.)

    Example:
        d = {'one': {2, 3}, 'two': {4, 5}}
        type_check(d, {str: {int}})  # Evaluates to True
        type_check(1, int)  # Evaluates to True

    Returns:
        True if the types of `val` correspond to the types of `types`.

    Raises:
        ValueError: `types` must have only one element at each level.

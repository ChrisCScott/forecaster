        See documentation for `Account` and `LinkedAccount`
        for information on any args not listed below.

        Args:
            owner (Person): The person who owns the account. Some types
                of accounts call this the "annuitant".

            contribution_room (Money): The amount of contribution room
                available in the first year. Optional.

                If not provided, this value will default to `None`,
                which makes it easier for subclasses to determine
                whether it has been set but, if those subclasses don't
                take care to set this manually, can lead to hard-to-
                diagnose errors in client code.

            contributor (Person): The contributor to the account.
                Optional.

                If not provided, the contributor is assumed to be the
                same as the annuitant (i.e. the owner.)

            inflation_adjust: A method with the following form:
                `inflation_adjust(val, this_year, target_year)`.

                Returns a Decimal object which is the inflation-
                adjustment factor from base_year to target_year.

                Optional. If not provided, all values are assumed to be
                in real terms, so no inflation adjustment is performed.

            max_inflow_token (str): A token that is used to link this
                account to any other accounts with the same token and
                contributor. Optional.

                If not provided then by default the max inflows of this
                account are linked with all other accounts of the same
                type having the same contributor.

            constants (ConstantsCanada): An object providing
                Canada-specific constants for determining account
                behaviour as attributes (e.g. `TFSA_ANNUAL_ACCRUAL`).
                Optional.

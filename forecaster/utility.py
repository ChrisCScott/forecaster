class Timing(dict):
    """ A dict of {timing: weight} pairs.

    This is really just a vanilla dict with a convenient init method.
    It divides the interval [0,1] into a number of equal-length periods
    equal to `frequency` and, within each period, assigns a timing at
    `when`. The timings are equally-weighted.

    This class provides a copy-constructor that can receive a dict of
    {when: value} pairs.

    Examples:
        Timing()

        # {0.25: 0.5, 0.75: 0.5}

        frequency (str, int): The number of periods (and thus the number

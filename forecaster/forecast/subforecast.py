    """ A defaultdict that accepts unhashable keys.

    The purpose of this dictionary is to allow `SubForecast` to have
    a `dict[dict[*], dict[float, float]]` data structure to map
    accounts (or account-like dicts) to {when: value} transaction
    mappings.

    When this dict encounters an unhashable object being used as a
    key, it uses the *id* of that object as a key instead. Calling
    code does not need to use the id; it can index this dict with
    the unhashable object and will receive the unhashable object
    as a key when iterating over the dict.

    This class implicitly treats identity as equality for non-hashable
    keys. This avoids hashing collisions between unhashable keys
    (since different keys have different identities) and between
    unhashable and hashable keys, so long as no hashable key is equal
    to an unhashable key's id. This is guaranteed if the hashable keys
    aren't equal to any integers (and, if they are `Account` objects,
    they won't be, so you should be fine!). Using integer (or integer-
    convertible) objects as keys may lead to unexpected behaviour due
    to hashing collisions (but even these are very unlikely!)

    NOTE: The behaviour of `keys()` is overridden for this class to
    return a list instead of a keyview. This mimics Python 2.x
    behaviour but is non-standard for Python 3.x.

class SubForecast(Ledger):
    """ Generic class for implementing part of a financial forecast.

    `SubForecast` instances are managed by a `Forecast` object. Each
    `SubForecast` instance receives a dict of cashflows when called
    and mutates it by adding or substracting from the cashflows.
    The mutated dict can then be passed to another `SubForecast` for
    further processing. The dict is called `available` and represents
    the amount of money available for use by subsequent `SubForecast`
    instances.

    In general, positive values indicate additions/deposits to the
    pool of money available for use, and negative values are
    substractions/withdrawals. E.g. when income is received, an
    `IncomeForecast` subclass instance might add positive values
    to `available`. A `LivingExpensesForecast` subclass instance
    might add negative values.

    In addition to mutating `available`, each `SubForecast` instance
    can manage accounts that money moves to/from. Much of the logic
    of this class deals with adding transactions to such accounts.
    Money can be moved from `available` to an account (or vice-versa),
    and those movements can be undone as well (via
    `undo_transactions`).

    This is a `Ledger` subclass, meaning that it provides
    `recorded_property` attributes with corresponding `*_history`
    dicts storing values of the properties over time. See the
    documentation of `Ledger` (or concrete subclasses like `Account`)
    for more information.

    Args:
        initial_year (int): The first year of the forecast.
            NOTE: Issue #53 removes the requirement for initial_year.
        default_timing (Timing): The timing of transactions to use if
            none is explicitly given to `add_transactions`.

    Attributes:
        transactions (TransactionDict[
            Union[Account, dict]: defaultdict[float, float]):
            A record of transactions to/from various accounts.

            object; it can be any `Mapping`, like a `dict`.

            Each account is mapped to time-series data (in the
            {when: value} format used throughout this package) where
            positive values correspond to inflows to inflows to the

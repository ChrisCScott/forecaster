class AccountLink:
    """ Links accounts via an owner so that they share a data record.

    Accounts are linked based on a `link` parameter (which should be
    interpretable as a `LinkTuple`, which has `owner` and `token`
    attributes.) Accounts do not necessarily need to have access to the
    same `AccountLink` object to be linked - `AccountLink` merely
    provides an interface by which Accounts can get access to the
    centrally-managed data record.

    NOTE: This class is intended to provide immutable attributes, such
    as `owner` and `token`. Immutability is not programmatically
    enforced. Try not to get yourself in trouble.

    Args:
        link (LinkTuple): A `(owner, token)` tuple (or anything
            convertible to LinkTuple) that uniquely identifies a group
            of linked accounts.

            Most commonly of type `tuple[Person, str]`. The first
            element (owner) must have a `data` attribute. The second
            element (token) must be hashable.
        default_factory (Callable): A callable object (e.g. a lambda
            expression) which takes no arguments and returns an object
            of any type. Inspired by `defaultdict`'s `default_factory`
            argument. Optional.

            The returned object is used to initialize the shared data
            record when the link is first registered.
            Defaults to `dict`.

    Attributes:
        owner (Person, Any): An object that holds the data shared by
            the linked accounts.
        token (str, Hashable): A value registered with `owner` which is
            shared by all accounts in this link group with this owner.
        default_factory (Callable): A callable object (e.g. a lambda
            expression) which takes no arguments and returns an object
            of any type. Inspired by `defaultdict`'s `default_factory`
            argument. Optional.

            The returned object is used to initialize `data` when the
            link is first registered. Defaults to `dict`.
        data (Any): The centrally-managed data record shared by all
            linked accounts. Can be of any type, which is determined by
            `default_factory`. Defaults to an empty `dict`.
        group (set): The group of all accounts linked by this
            owner/token pair.

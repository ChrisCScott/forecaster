class Debt(Account):
    """ A debt with a balance and an interest rate.

    If there is an outstanding balance, the balance value will be a
    *negative* value, in line with typical accounting principles.

    Args:
        minimum_payment (Money): The minimum annual payment on the debt.
            Optional.
        living_expense (Money): The amount paid annually out of living
            expenses. This portion of payments is excluded from
            the amount determined by `savings_rate`. If payments for
            a given year are less than this value, they are 100%
            excluded from `savings_rate`. (The total payment amount
            is not increased to match this value.) Optional.
        savings_rate (Decimal): The amount of any payment (in excess
            of `living_expense`) to be drawn from savings instead of
            living expenses. Expressed as the percentage that's drawn
            from savings (e.g. 75% drawn from savings would be
            `Decimal('0.75')`). Optional.
        accelerated_payment (Money): The maximum value which may be
            paid in a year (above `minimum_payment`) to pay off the
            balance earlier. Optional.

            Debts may be accelerated by as much as possible by setting
            this argument to `Money('Infinity')`, or non-accelerated
            by setting this argument to `Money(0)`.
        default_timing (Timing, dict[float, float]): The timings of
            payments and the weight of each payment timing. Optional.

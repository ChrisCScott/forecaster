# Some of this class relates to generating the correct inputs for the

class TransactionTraversal(HighPrecisionOptional):
    """ Determines transactions to/from accounts based on a priority.

    Instances of this class, when initialized, receive a
    `TransactionNode` (or a data structure that is convertible to
    `TransactionNode`, e.g. `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, and/or `Account`).
    This is usually expressible as a tree (and this documentation
    usually describes it as as the "priority tree"), but a true tree
    structure is not required; for example, nodes can share children
    (even across levels).
    In fact, it often is not semantically a tree in practice, since
    leaf nodes (usually `Account` objects) can share contribution room
    or have other relationships not captured by the tree structure.

    Instances of this class, when called, traverse a representation of
    the priority tree to allocate transactions to the leaves (which are
    assumed to be accounts, although as described below they do not need
    to inherit from `Account`). The traversal is breadth-first, so that
    higher-level relationships are enforced in preference to lower-level
    relationships. For example:

    *   all lower-level ordered nodes will be exhausted before
        moving on to the next ordered node at a higher level; and
    *   all lower-level weighted nodes will be forced to deviate from
        their target allocation as much as necessary to minimize
        deviations by higher-order weighted nodes.

    This class generates a directed graph based on the input which
    represents the  relationships between nodes. It finds a minimum-cost
    maximum flow across the graph which it translates into transactions
    for each leaf node (usually `Account` objects). By default, it does this
    twice, once to allocate minimum transactions and then again to
    allocate maximum transactions.

    The semantics of `TransactionNode` inputs are respected, including
    limits on min/max in/outflows. See documentation for
    `TransactionNode` for more detail.

    As with all `Strategy` objects, objects of this type are callable
    and will return a result resulting from their various settings; in
    this case, a mapping of leaf nodes to transactions.

    Usually leaf nodes are `Account` objects, but any type can be used.
    If using another type, be sure to provide `transaction_methods`
    and `group_methods` that support all of the leaf nodes' types.

    Examples:
        Collections can be nested (note also that `account2` repeats)::

            subgroup = {account1: 0.5, account2: 0.5}
            priority = [subgroup, account2]  # valid priority tree
            strategy = TransactionStrategy(priority)
            transactions = strategy(available)

        We can limit the total amount to contribute to `subgroup`
        (i.e. the equal-weighted group of account1 and account2)
        by using a single-element dict, as follows::

            limit = LimitTuple(max_inflows=Money(100))
            subgroup = TransactionNode(subgroup, limit=limit)
            priority = [subgroup, account2]
            strategy = TransactionStrategy(priority)
            transactions = strategy(available)

        The result, assuming available represents net inflows, is that
        up to $100 will be contributed equally to `account1` and
        `account2`, with any excess going to `account2`

    Attributes:
        priority (TransactionNode, list[Any], dict[Any, float],
            tuple[Any]): The (nested) collection of `Account` objects.
        graph (networkx.DiGraph): A directed graph representing all of
            the nodes from `priority`.
        source (Hashable): The node to use as the source of all flows.
        sink (Hashable): The node to use as the destination of all
            flows.
        memo (dict[Hashable, dict[Hashable, int]]): A record of all
            flows assigned by various invocations of
            `_traverse_priority`.
        overflow_nodes (dict[Hashable, Hashable]): A mapping of
            `node: overflow_node` pairs.
        outbound_nodes (dict[Hashable, Hashable]): A mapping of
            `node: outbound_node` pairs. Optional.
        transaction_methods (LimitTuple[Callable]): A tuple of methods,
            each taking a leaf node as the sole argument and returning a
            transactions object (i.e. a `dict[float, Money]` map of
            timings to values).
            Each method of the tuple respects a different limit (e.g.
            `min_inflows`, `max_outflows`).
            Optional. If not provided, methods supporting `Account`-type
            leaf nodes will be used.
        group_methods (LimitTuple[Callable]): A tuple of methods,
            each taking a leaf node as the sole argument and returning a
            group of linked accounts (i.e. a `set[Account]` or, more
            generally, `set[T]` where `T` is any valid type for a leaf
            node in `priority`).
            Each method of the tuple corresponds to a different link
            (e.g. `max_inflow_link`, `min_outflow_link`).
            Optional. If not provided, methods supporting `Account`-type
            leaf nodes will be used.
        precision (float, float): Results will be rounded to this
            level of precision.

    Args:
        available (dict[float, Money]): A time series of inflows
            and outflows, where keys are timings and values are
            inflows (positive) or outflows (negative).
        total (Money): The total amount of inflows/outflows to be
            allocated between the accounts represented in the
            `priority` tree. Optional. If not provided, the sum
            total of `available` will be allocated.
        assign_min (Bool): If True, minimum inflows/outflows
            will be assigned first (in `priority` order, so if
            `total` is less than the sum of minimum inflows/outflows
            then low-priority will not have transactions assigned).
            Remaining money is then allocated in `priority` order,
            up to any limits on maximum inflows/outflows.

            If False, minimum inflows/outflows will not be assigned
            and the strategy will move directly to assigning up to
            the maximum inflows/outflows.

            Optional. Defaults to True.
        high_precision (Callable[[float], T]): A conversion method
            that converts float internal constants to a high-precision
            numerical type `T`. Optional.

    Returns:
        dict[Hashable, dict[float, Money]]: A mapping of accounts to
            transactions to (positive) or from (negative) those
            accounts. No `list`, `dict`, or other sub-collection is
            used as a key. Only the leaf node `Account`-like objects of
            the tree defined by `priority` are used as keys.

        The generated graph represents each node of `priority`, as well

        and acyclic, provided that `priority` is acyclic. This method
        is not guaranteed to halt (and probably won't!) if `priority`
        has a cycle.

        This method also adds various nodes to support a network flow
        algorithm, including:

        *   a `source` node for flow to originate at and travel from;
        *   a `sink` node for flow to travel to and terminate at;
        *   limit nodes (if applicable) which allow for the addition of
            an edge with limited capacity to be added between a node and
            its children to enforce any per-node limit;
        *   group nodes (if applicable) which several accounts in a
            group may direct flow through to enforce shared group
            limits; and
        *   overflow nodes (if applicable) for weighted nodes which
            allow for flows to children to be reallocated when the
            default weighted allocation isn't possible.

        Edges may be weighted or unweighted (in which case they are
        treated as having 0 weight). Weighted edges are used to enforce
        ordering of flow paths among ordered nodes' children, and to
        disincentivize flow through overflow nodes (thus prioritizing
        the default allocation).

        To execute successfully, this method needs to receive any kwargs
        required by any lower-level `_add_*` methods that are called
        for each node in `priority`. This usually means that at least
        `limit` and `timing` must be provided. (See the
        `_traverse_priority` documentation.)

        Examples:
            ```
                                       T1 -> L1 -> A1
                N                     /              \\
               / \\    -->  source -> N                sink
              T1 T2                   \\              /
                                       T2 -> L2 -> A2
            ```
            In this example, N is an ordered node with children T1 and
            T2 which are leaf nodes wrapping accounts A1 and A2,
            respectively. The `source -> N` edge has a capacity limited
            to `total`. The `T1 -> L1` and `T2 -> L2` edges have
            capacity limited to the applicable `limit` value for T1 and
            T2, respectively. The capacity of the edges directed at
            sink is limited to the applicable
            min_inflow/max_outflow/etc. value for A1 and A2 for the
            given `timing`. The `N -> T1` edge has 0 weight, whereas
            the `N -> T2` weight is larger than any path flow can take
            from T1 to sink (forcing flow to exhaust all such paths
            first).

            (In practice, N might have its own limit node, not shown
            here.)

            If the previous example is modified so that A1 and A2
            are `LinkLimitAccount`s with shared `max_inflow` values
            then the graph would look like this:
            ```
                                       T1 -> L1 -> A1
                N                     /              \\
               / \\    -->  source -> N                group -> sink
              T1 T2                   \\              /
                                       T2 -> L2 -> A2
            ```
            In this case, the `A1 -> group` edge has the same capacity
            as the above `A1 -> sink` edge, but now the `group -> sink`
            edge also has that capacity, so the total amount contributed
            to A1 and A2 will not exceed their shared limit.

            Weighted nodes are a little more complicated because they
            add an overflow node:
            ```
                                        -> T1 -> L1 -> A1
                                       /   |           \\
                N                     /    |            \\
               / \\    -->  source -> N -> O              group -> sink
              T1 T2                   \\   |              /
                                       \\  |             /
                                        -> T2 -> L2 -> A2
            ```
            Here the `N -> O` edge is weighted with unlimited capacity
            and the `N -> T1` and `N -> T2` edges are unweighted with
            limited capacity. In particular, their capacity is
            determined based on the weightings provided by `N.children`.

            In practice, by the time this method completes no flow will
            pass through overflow node O. This is because the capacities
            of the `N -> T1` and `N -> T2` edges have been repeatedly
            rebalanced to reallocate those overflows proportionately
            to the weights of any children that can accept additional
            flow.

        Args:

        """ Attempts to shift flow between children to match weights.

        Based on the flows from `node` to `children`, we can identify 3
        sets of child nodes.
        (References to a child's "capacity" below refers to the
        capacity of all zero-weight paths from `node` to the child.)

        1. Underflow nodes: Flow to these nodes from `node` is less than
            their capacity.
        2. Overflow nodes: Flow to these nodes exceeds their capacity
            (i.e. they receive flow over non-zero-weight paths).
        3. Saturated nodes: All nodes that are not underflow or overflow
            nodes. These have received exactly their capacity in flows.

        There is no guarantee that overflow and underflow nodes are
        weighted properly relative to each other, since there's no
        mechanism to force flows through a set of identically-weighted
        paths to adhere to a certain proportion of flows. This method
        recurses onto each of those sets of children separately,
        thereby attempting to reallocate capacity between them in a way
        that respects weightings.

        We know we can recurse on those sets of nodes separately because
        overflow nodes only receive flow if they _must_, and underflow
        nodes only fail to reach saturation if it's _impossible_ to do
        so (so long as total flow through `node` is at least as large
        as the capacity of the children - which this method enforces).

        Saturated nodes are included when recursing onto both underflow
        and overflow nodes. This is because it's possible for a
        saturated node to share capacity with underflow or overflow
        nodes. It might be appropriate to reallocate capacity from a
        saturated node to an underflow node and/or to reallocate
        capacity from an overflow node to a saturated node.

                If not provided, all children of `node` are rebalanced.

                reassign capacities if they don't match total flows.
                It sets this to `False` on recursion to avoid infinite

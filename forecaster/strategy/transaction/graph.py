    *   Underflow nodes definitely *are*. Paths from underflow nodes to
        `sink` cannot accomodate the current outbound capacity.
    *   Overflow nodes definitely *are not*. Flow intended for
        underflow nodes has been redirected to them because paths from
        those nodes to `sink` have excess capacity.
    *   Saturated nodes might go either way. It might be that they have
        excess capacity which simply wasn't used by the flow-assigning
        algorithm, or they might have consumed 100% of their capacity
        (and thus implicitly be bottlenecks insofar as the question of
        where to assign excess capacity is concerned.)

    Args:
        graph (networkx.DiGraph): A directed graph.
        node (Hashable): A node in `graph`
        children (Iterable[Hashable]): A collection of `node`'s children
            to which overflows should _not_ be restricted.
        flows (dict[Hashable: dict[Hashable: int]]): Flows as
            `from_node: (to_node: flow_value)` triples. Optional.
        outbound_nodes (dict[Hashable, Hashable]): A mapping of
            `node: outbound_node` pairs. Optional.
        overflow_nodes (dict[Hashable, Hashable]): A mapping of
            `node: overflow_node` pairs. Optional.

    Returns:
        tuple[set[Hashable], set[Hashable], set[Hashable]]: The nodes in
        `children`, divided into disjoint sets as follows:
        `(underflow_nodes, overflow_nodes, saturated_nodes)`.

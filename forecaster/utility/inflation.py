def nearest_year(vals, year):
    """ Finds the nearest (past) year to `year` in `vals`.

    This is a companion method to `inflation_adjust()`. It's meant to be
    used when you want to pull a value out of an incomplete dict without
    inflation-adjusting it (e.g. when you want to grab the most recent
    percentage rate from a dict of `{year: Decimal}` pairs.)

    If `year` is in `vals`, then this method returns `year`.
    If not, then this method tries to find the last year
    before `year` that is in `vals`. If that doesn't work, then this
    method tries to find the first year in `vals` following `year`.

    Returns:
        A year in `vals` is near to `year`, preferring
        the nearest preceding year (if it exists) over the nearest
        following year.

        Returns `None` if `vals` is empty.

def extend_inflation_adjusted(vals, inflation_adjust, target_year):
    """ Fills in partial time-series with inflation-adjusted values.

    This method is targeted at inflation-adjusting input data (e.g.
    as found in the Constants module), which tends to be incomplete
    and can represent non-sequential years. New years are often entered
    when something changes (i.e. when values change in real terms), so
    this method prefers to infer inflation-adjusted values based on the
    most recent *past* years when possible (since future years might
    not be comparable).

    If `target_year` is in `vals`, then this method returns the value
    for `target_year` in `vals` without further inflation-adjusting
    (as that value is already in nominal terms).

    If `target_year` is not in `vals`, then this method attempts to
    interpolate an inflation-adjusted value based on the last year in
    `vals` before `target_year` or, if no such year exists, based on the
    first year in `vals` after `target_year`.

    If the values of `vals` are dicts or other iterable, this method
    returns a dict or other iterable with values that have each been
    inflation-adjusted.

    Args:
        vals (dict): A dict of `{year: val}` pairs, where `val` is a
            scalar, list, or dict. This dict may be incomplete, in the
            sense that some years may not be represented.

            If `val` is non-scalar, an object of the same type is
            returned with each of its values inflation-adjusted.
        inflation_adjust: A method of the form
            `inflation_adjust(val, this_year, target_year)` that finds a
            nominal value in `target_year` with the same real value as
            nominal value `val` in `this_year`.

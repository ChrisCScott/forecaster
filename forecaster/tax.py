#   tax_refund_or_owing (total refund paid to persons or amount owing to

# One of the challenges with this approach is that tax objects may be

# NOTE: Federal and provincial deduction and credit are separate;

class Tax(object):
    """ Determines taxes payable on taxable income.

    When called with a Money-type first argument (i.e. as
    `tax(taxable_income, year)`), this object returns the amount of tax
    payable on taxable income without any source-specific deduction or
    credit. This should correspond to how employment withholding taxes
    are calculated, so `gross_income - tax(gross_income, year)`
    will return a person's net income.

    For a more sophisticated assessment of credit/etc., provide a
    `Person` object as input (or an iterable of `Person` objects). This
    will assess taxable income, credits, and deductions for the `Person`
    and any `Account` objects they own.

    Thus, calling `tax({person1, person2}, year)` will
    return the total tax liability for the year for both person1 and
    person2, after applying any credit/etc., and including the
    employment income and taxable account activity of each `Person`.

    If spouses are passed in, they are processed together.

    Attributes:
        tax_brackets (dict): A dict of `{year: brackets}` pairs, where
            `brackets` is a dict of `{bracket: rate}` pairs. `bracket`
            must be convertible to Money and `rate` must be convertible
            to Decimal. `rate` will be interpreted as a percentage (e.g.
            Decimal('0.03') is interpreted as 3%)
        personal_deduction (dict): A dict of `{year: deduction}` pairs,
            where `deduction` is convertible to Money.

            The personal deduction for a given year is deducted from
            income when determining income tax in that year.
        credit_rate (dict): A dict of `{year: rate}` pairs, where `rate`
            is convertible to Decimal.

            The credit rate is used to determine how much each tax
            credit reduced total tax liability.
        accum (dict): A dict of `{year: {bracket: accum}}` pairs, where
            each `bracket` corresponds to a key in `tax_brackets` and
            `accum` is the sum of tax payable on the income falling into
            all lower brackets.

            For example, if there are $10, $100, and $1000 tax brackets,
            then `accum[year][$1000]` is equal to::

                tax_brackets[year][10] * 10 + tax_brackets[year][100] * 100

        inflation_adjust: A method with the following form:
            `inflation_adjust(target_year, base_year)`.

            Returns a Decimal scaling factor. Multiplying this by a
            nominal value in base_year will yield a nominal value in
            target_year with the same real value.

            Optional. If not provided, all values are assumed to be in
            real terms, so no inflation adjustment is performed.

    Args:
        taxable_income (Money, iterable): Taxable income for the year,
            either as a single scalar Money object or as an iterable
            (list, set, etc.) of sources of taxable income (i.e.
            Person/Account objects).
        year (int): The taxation year. This determines which tax rules
            and inflation-adjusted brackets are used.
        deduction (Money): Any other deduction which can be
            applied and which aren't evident from the income sources
            themselves. These will generally be itemized deduction.

            It's a good idea to be familiar with the Tax implementation
            you're working with before passing any of these, otherwise
            you risk double-counting.

            Optional.
        credit (Money): Any other tax credit which can be
            applied and which aren't evident from the income sources
            themselves. These will generally be boutique tax credit.

            Optional.

    in which case the value for the _first_ jurisdiction is returned.
    This behaviour may be modified by subclasses where combinations are
    known (e.g. where different jurisdictions coordinate timings.)

    Attributes:
        jurisdictions (Tuple[Tax]): One or more jurisdictions' tax
            treatment for a given taxpayer.
        tax_brackets (dict[int, dict[Money, Decimal]]): The combined tax
            brackets of `juridctions`.
        personal_deduction (dict[int, Money]): The combined personal
            deductions A dict of `{year: deduction}` pairs,
            where `deduction` is convertible to Money.

            The personal deduction for a given year is deducted from
            income when determining income tax in that year.
        credit_rate (dict): A dict of `{year: rate}` pairs, where `rate`
            is convertible to Decimal.

            The credit rate is used to determine how much each tax
            credit reduced total tax liability.
        accum (dict): A dict of `{year: {bracket: accum}}` pairs, where
            each `bracket` corresponds to a key in `tax_brackets` and
            `accum` is the sum of tax payable on the income falling into
            all lower brackets.

            For example, if there are $10, $100, and $1000 tax brackets,
            then `accum[year][$1000]` is equal to::

                tax_brackets[year][10] * 10 + tax_brackets[year][100] * 100

        inflation_adjust: A method with the following form:
            `inflation_adjust(target_year, base_year)`.

            Returns a Decimal scaling factor. Multiplying this by a
            nominal value in base_year will yield a nominal value in
            target_year with the same real value.

            Optional. If not provided, all values are assumed to be in
            real terms, so no inflation adjustment is performed.
